        "review": "I really enjoyed this movie. I watched it originally in 2023 during a horror movie kick and really enjoyed it. This year I had the opritunity of showing it to two more friends who hadn't seen it yet. Watching it a second time to see their thoughts on what was going on was very worth while. The plot sounds like a recipe for failure, its a movie in black and white with only two characters interacting in one places for the whole film. That sounds so boring but in execution it is incredible. Psycologically and cinematically it is very good at keeping you gripped. It is no feel good movie so keep that in mind if you decide to watch it.",

        "review": "While I wouldn't classify this movie as high art or anything like that, it was very entertaining. I liked what they were going for and how this is an actual movie. Too many big budget films focus on being only part of a whole whereas this film feels like it is complete, no need for many films worth of context.",

        "review": "My friend and me finished the original Neon Genesis Evangelion tv show at the start of this year. We knew of the fact that movies existed but made little effort to seek them out. However the perfect oppritunity arose when for the first time ever this film was released in theaters in the US, it was released originally in 1997. That being said, this was my first movie theater experience of the year and I feel like I gained back some love for theaters in the process. The original TV show focused in on heavier tones and plot points meant to shock you at times it was nowhere near as gruesome, shocking, and violent as this movie was. I was in awe as the tone was completely different and the movie was incredibly heavy. I was speechless at the end it was like a nightmare. Overall I very much enjoyed the movie and I am interested to see how my outlook on it develops with time.",

Very emotional and incredibly reserved portions of this movie. Easily one of the best Evangelion related pieces of media. It was nice seeing a happy ending for a change too. This series is very bleak, one of the most notable things about the orignial 'End of Evangelion' movie was how bleak it was. Its impressive how this movie mananged to keep the heaviness without sacrificing a feel-good ending ",

I only ended up seeing it because my roomates were watching it. I can see why there was so much hype. It's incredibly high quality on all fronts and was really intriguing too. I always avoid romance because it tends to be formulaic in a way I find boring, but this movie has opened my eyes to the fact that I was generalizing too much!",

Heriditary is one of my favorite movies and I went into this film orginally with high expectations and was not disappointed. In recent times however i've discovered that opinions on this movie are more of a mixed bag. I saw people online whom I knew calling this film bad, bland, cheap and I was suprised because that was not my appraisal at all. Generally when it comes to movies my opinions tend to align very closely with the general opinion on them. This always made me feel as though my taste in movies was basic. But suprisingly on a second watch with more critical thinking, I still enjoyed it a lot.",
