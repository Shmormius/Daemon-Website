        "review": "This show is very artistically rich. I really like learning about the world and characters. However it falls into some typical anime tropes that I don't really like. It can go from being masterful in one episode to just uncomforatble or bland on the next but generally keeps a good overall quality. The last two episodes weren't the best in my eyes but they are retconned by the movie so I dont really consider them when looking at the storys end. Overall I recommend it but only to those with open minds.",

        "review": "When we started watching this show I was startled by the animation. It is rotoscoped, I think, completely all character movement is clearly outlined animation of a real person and it looks really funky. To the show's credit I really like how it looks, and the wonkiness provides an uncomfortable feeling that matches the show perfectly. In fact the whole show was extremely uncomfortable but that was clearly by design. My one big gripe is the nonsense ending. I love media that is unclear, or up to interpretation, but this felt a little to much like a slideshow saing \"Oops! we ran out of time/money.\" Overall I think people who want something unique should try it.",

        "review": "Its kind of embarrising to me that it is mostly animation on this list but its what I watch with my roomates and I do not watch TV or movies on my own apparently. Anyways, I didn't really care for this very much. Felt souless at times and was often carried by the design or art, when that was lacking, a 20 minute episode could feel like an hour. I enjoyed the main character's development emotionally but that was not enough to carry it above a 2 star ratting.",
