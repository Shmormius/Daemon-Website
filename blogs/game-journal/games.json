As an adult coming back to it I've found that all it takes is a change of mindset. I think it is fun, like most games from this era incredibly difficult especially if you've been pampered like me by gentle game design in recent years. The music is also so cool.",

I really find this game fun, while that can be controversial I think that this game is fun for what it is and I think little about what it could have been. It certainly lacks some of the spark that the other games in the series have, but I think its good in a different way.",
