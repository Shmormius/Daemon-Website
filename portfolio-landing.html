                                This project was my submission for the CS 370
                                Operating Systems term project.
                                The project rules were to group up into groups
                                of 2-3 people and make something using a
                                Raspberry Pi.
                                In this process I learned a great deal about the
                                development process and how to leverage hardware
                                restrictions.
                                We had the whole term to work so leveraging our
                                time and avalibility to complete the project was
                                another challenge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We had decided on using our Pi to control a
                                rover and developed a systems through which a
                                user could provide coordinates over a desktop
                                interface, and the rover would seek those
                                coordniates.
                                The program works by establishing a local server
                                using flask on the Raspberry pi. Then the user
                                would access the server via a webpage and type
                                the coordniates. The Pi would then compute the
                                instruction and send orders to an arduino that
                                operates the rover.
                                Not being robotics engineers the rover itself
                                looks rather shabby but luckily functions. Using
                                an onboard battery, a gps sensor, an arduino,
                                and the PI itself its able to navagate to
                                coordnates provided via the web.

                            <p>This one feels pretty self explanatory, but the
                                portfolio website I am refering to is the
                                website you are currently on.
                                This website has gone through three major
                                revisions. The first version followed a Youtube
                                video and relied very heavily on Javascript to
                                function.
                                However after reading a book on web design I
                                learned its probably best to make the website
                                still functional without Javascript.
                                Thus the second version was very basic and
                                relied mostly on its HTML for structure and
                                funtion. This version is the third version and
                                was a complete restart having learned from the
                                other two.
                                This website was built from the bottom up using
                                no outside website making programs.

                                This is my attempt at the producer-consumer
                                problem using bounded buffer.
                                Main starts two threads, producerThread and
                                consumerThread which start the consumer and
                                producer process.
                                producer creates random double 'item' and checks
                                if buffer size is equal to 1000, if it is, it
                                waits for the consumer to consume one element.
                                It adds the item to the buffer and icrements the
                                counter of total produced items and adds the
                                value to the sum of the produced items.
                                consumer removes the oldest value in the buffer,
                                maintains a value of the sum of the consumed
                                items.
                                Finally after enoughed items are consumed main
                                takes the two threads and joins them back
                                together.

                                This is a ASCII to binary converter I coded in
                                Assembly. This was completed for use on CSU's
                                LC3 simulator.
                                This program features many of the unique aspects
                                of coding in assembly, the most annoying of
                                which is the importance of good comments.
                                While Assembly is not useful practially anymore
                                as it once was, I beleive this project showcases
                                my knowledge of the underlying functions behind
                                much of coding.

                                This was the last thing major thing i did in
                                Blender before taking a long hiatus to focus on
                                computer science.
                                I'm happy overall with out this turned out but I
                                cant help but notice many problems with it.
                                Everything in this scence was modeled by me.

                            This is my favorite poly-modeling project. It is
                            based on a mini gong that I have in my apartment. I
                            have trained my cats to all come once I ring it.
                            I got the symbols directly from my gong by taking a
                            picture adjusting it until I had a clear alpha of
                            the shape of the symbol.

                                This is my high school senior capstone project.
                                At the time I wanted to deticate myself to
                                making a strong urban scene which is something I
                                had never done before this.
                                I had a lot of spare time due to the Covid-19
                                pandemic and thus a lot of hours were poured
                                into this.

                                    This scene was created in order for me to
                                    attempt at making a rainy window,
                                    houseplants, and fancy light-bulbs. Im happy
                                    with how those aspects turned out however
                                    you can see how i am cutting corners in a
                                    couple places.
                                    Many of the models in these scene I took
                                    from my other projects and because of that
                                    can be seen in a couple other scenes as
                                    well. The guitar is from before I learned to
                                    poly model well, so there is some
                                    artifacting.
                                    The computer tower was made in under 5
                                    minutes and because of that it is easily the
                                    weakest part of this. Also the painting on
                                    the wall is my favorite paining of all time
                                    "City Lights" by Flooko.

                                        fun game, but after a game of it at my
                                        grandparents I decied to try my hand at
                                        modeling our game, with various other

                                        remarkable thing to come out of a dining
                                        room scene that I had tried to make.
                                        Particularly love this model because I
                                        managed to get finger prints on it.
                                        Like many others you can see this model
                                        makes it's way into a lot of my scenes.

                                        This candle is made based on a tutorial
                                        on how to make a candle's flame. The
                                        background, plate, and overall render
                                        are the parts that diverge from the
                                        tutorial.

                                        This cup is modeled after my mom's cup
                                        that I saw her using one day. The cup is
                                        vintage and was given away by my
                                        great-uncle and unfortunatly broke after
                                        I modeled it but we can see it here
                                        being put to good use.

                                        This is some modeling practice I did
                                        with normal maps.

                                        Still not sure how I managed to do this
                                        considering this was one of the earliest
                                        renders I have ever done. I think my
                                        experience in computer aided drafting
                                        actually helped me here.

                                        These are some environments. The First
                                        is based on a drawing online, the second
                                        is based on a atmosphere and space
                                        tutorial.
                                        The grass one is my favorite and is from
                                        when I learned to use alfa to specify
                                        what to texture and what to not.

                                        for 4+ years until I moved to Fort
                                        Collins. I just recently bought a new
                                        one that proudly hangs in my apartment
                                        from August until November.
